# Keele University - uok-core
## University of Keele core files
SASS ~~and JS~~ repo of core CMS styles.

Based on Node (including npm) and Grunt.

This repo is a rebase of the old CodeKit setup.

## What you'll need
You will need to have NodeJS (including NPM), Git, Ruby (including RubyGems) and Compass installed on your machine.

Gem bundler from <http://bundler.io/>. For fresh machines, run `gem install bundler` and then `bundle install` to get sass, compass etc installed.

Note that it is highliy recommended that you use e.g. rbenv on MacOSx to run alternative versions of ruby to the System version. It will also avoid any permission changes to the core Mac ruby install. See https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#homebrew-on-macos
